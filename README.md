Webernote
=========

[Webernote](http://anti-code.com/webernote/) is a webapp version of Evernote's *desktop application* that I made for an interview I had, which became a pet project that I've built using regular JavaScript, then Backbone.js, and now this version which is built with Angular.js.

This app uses [Firebase](http://firebase.com) for storing data as it provides a RESTful API for communicating with the server in real-time. All changes to data happen instantly. Firebase also provides an authentication library for simplifying multiple options for authentication through Oauth APIs. The option to use custom authentication is also provided alternatively.


## Getting Setup
----------------------------------------------

This app uses [Yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io), [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.com).
Within Yeoman, the [angular-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) is also being used to automate the creation of new modules and the initial scaffolding of the folder structure.


To set up the app for developing, **clone the repository angular branch**:

`git clone -b angular git@github.com:jaredwilli/webernote.git`


Install Yeoman, Grunt and Bower:

`npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`


Install the packages:

`npm install`
`bower install`


## Running and Testing
----------------------------------------------

Once the packages are installed, and all the dependencies exist, **run the server** using:

`grunt server`


To run the Jasmine test specs use:

`grunt test`


Build the app using:

`grunt`


## Creating Modules
----------------------------------------------

Creating new modules is easy. Yeoman simplifies things for you allowing you to use the command line to create and inject modules. The scripts are added to the footer of the index.html file, along with the script file and a matching test spec file will also be created, too.
